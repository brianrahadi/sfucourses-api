The lectures just read the slides. Exams don't test understanding or coding, only memorization. Assignments take 10–20 hours and are worth 70%, but if you fail the exam average (15% each), they won't help. One bad exam can ruin your grade—drop early if caught off guard.", "helpful": "0", "not_helpful": "0", "tags": ["Tough grader", "Test heavy", "Online Savvy"]}]}
