So sad he only taught one semester here. Assignments were not too bad and exams were straight forward as long as you went over the slides. Really wants you to understand OS's instead of giving head-banging problems to solve. He really cares if you learn the material and is very approachable. If you see a class with Kai, take it for sure!", "helpful": "1", "not_helpful": "0", "tags": ["Respected", "Inspirational", "Caring"]}, {"rating": "3.0", "difficulty": "2.0", "course_code": "CMPT300", "date": "Jul 19th, 2018", "metadata": {"For Credit": "Yes", "Attendance": "Not Mandatory", "Would Take Again": "Yes", "Grade": "Not sure yet", "Textbook": "Yes"}, "review_msg": "He cares about his teaching. He puts effort into his slides and practices lectures. He is on a teaching exchange so his English skills are sometimes a barrier - mostly when it comes to answering student questions. When he is actually explaining material, it is ok to understand. The homework got exponentially harder after A1.
