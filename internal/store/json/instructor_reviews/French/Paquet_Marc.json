Passionate about teaching and he will use different approaches for students at different levels to understand. Great atmosphere.. you'll walk out of the class saying bye to every single person. I've had two courses with him with great results, and I hope to see him in upper level courses! TAKE IT!", "helpful": "0", "not_helpful": "0", "tags": []}]}
