She's expressed to me how she is wanting to change the French curriculum here at SFU which is great. She pushes for conveying ideas more than how perfect you can write in French, however syntax and grammar is still important (just 10-20% though). Her lectures are always engaging and always inspiring.", "helpful": "0", "not_helpful": "0", "tags": ["Amazing lectures ", "Gives good feedback", "Caring"]}, {"rating": "1.0", "difficulty": "5.0", "course_code": "FREN122", "date": "Dec 1st, 2021", "metadata": {"For Credit": "Yes", "Attendance": "Not Mandatory", "Would Take Again": "No", "Grade": "A-", "Textbook": "No"}, "review_msg": "DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS I took this class as an easy A because I was in French immersion for 6 years and this course was tough even for me (semi fluet) She talked in French almost the entire class expecting everyone to understand her when very few did.
