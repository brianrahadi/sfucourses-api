She was really nice, but she started her first lecture by essentially saying she was a PhD student, so if we had questions make sure they weren't questions answered somewhere else b/c she doesn't have time. Kind of disorganized, pretty much assigned readings and videos and didn't teach much. Grading was not clear.", "helpful": "0", "not_helpful": "0", "tags": ["Get ready to read"]}]}
