She's one-in-a-million and it's unfortunate more profs aren't as demanding and rewarding. Always willing to help and give extra chances if you've proven you're making a sincere effort.

She is almost completely unresponsive to criticism or questions during lecture, but is also perfectly willing to give tons of help outside of class hours.
