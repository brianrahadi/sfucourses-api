Taking this class was such a riveting and thought-provoking experience. We learned how to apply ethnography to daily life- noticing and accessing the details of life as an ethnographic story.

The class was super engaging and she gave great feedback.  She was also a good marker who looked at the content rather than criticized the format of how you wrote your assignments. She definitely enjoyed what was she teaching.  The class was a 4 hour lecture in sort of a tutorial format.  Highly recommend.

She is extremely approachable inside and outside of class. She creates a great atmosphere with her classroom. She managed to get everyone engaged even though it was an 8:30am class.
