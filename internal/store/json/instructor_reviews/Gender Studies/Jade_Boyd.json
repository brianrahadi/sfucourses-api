It was my favourite course for Spring 2016. I'm dissapointed that SFU did not hire her. I would love to take more courses with her. She is passionate about what she teaches and has lots of good real life advice about Qualitative research.", "helpful": "0", "not_helpful": "0", "tags": []}, {"rating": "5.0", "difficulty": "1.0", "course_code": "GSWS204", "date": "Aug 18th, 2013", "metadata": {"Attendance": "Mandatory", "Textbook": "No"}, "review_msg": "Jade is a nice lady and is an easy marker for the most part. taking lecture notes are pointless because gsws 204 is purely based on papers. even the in-class open book exam is based on academic articles. there is no exam/paper that requires you to know lecture notes. class is easy, but pretty boring. not much effort is required to get a good grade", "helpful": "0", "not_helpful": "0", "tags": []}]}
