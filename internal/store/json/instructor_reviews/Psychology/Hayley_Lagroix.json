She was helpful in office hours and after class. Lectures are dense but overlap with the textbook. The 3 non-cumulative multiple choice exams are very easy if you put the work in. Group presentation is confusing. Easiest psychology class I've taken at SFU.", "helpful": "0", "not_helpful": "0", "tags": ["Get ready to read", "TEST HEAVY", "GRADED BY FEW THINGS"]}, {"rating": "2.0", "difficulty": "1.0", "course_code": "PSYC303", "date": "Mar 22nd, 2017", "metadata": {"For Credit": "Yes", "Attendance": "Not Mandatory", "Would Take Again": "No", "Grade": "Not sure yet", "Textbook": "Yes"}, "review_msg": "Your typical psyc class with some extra triggering stuff. Lectures are boring & notes are disorganized so your best shot is to study the textbook for the exam. Which btw is like $200 and there's only one in the library, in reserved section no less.
