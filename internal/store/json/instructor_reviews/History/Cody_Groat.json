You can tell he cares deeply about both his students and the course content. You learn a ton in his class, but definitely have to work hard as he gives a decent amount of homework and is heavy on the readings. Overall great prof, I will definitely try to take more of his classes in the future.", "helpful": "0", "not_helpful": "0", "tags": ["Gives good feedback", "Accessible outside class", "Participation matters"]}]}
