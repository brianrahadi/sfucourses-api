She created such a welcoming atmosphere, I felt completely comfortable engaging class discussions for the first time. Despite being a 4 hour evening class, she made it enjoyable and engaging. The assignments aren't difficult at all, just time consuming. I'd definitely take another course with her!", "helpful": "0", "not_helpful": "0", "tags": ["Participation matters", "Amazing lectures ", "Caring"]}]}
