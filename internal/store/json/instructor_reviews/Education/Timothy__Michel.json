Tim was a fantastic guy who has a pure passion for education; the lectures can be dry, but I'd rather sit in on a class in which I understood what was going on, then be dumbfounded the entire time. A huge online component, but the largest essay we had to write was only 700 words.

While it is a designated W class, he doesn't help you develop your writing,  bc of how the class is structured, nor are the essay topics asking you actual questions. He is also a really dry lecturer & pauses a bit too much. Wouldn't take a class with him again unless I had to.", "helpful": "0", "not_helpful": "1", "tags": []}]}
