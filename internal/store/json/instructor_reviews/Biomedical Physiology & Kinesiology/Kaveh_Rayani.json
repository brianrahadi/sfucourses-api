He explains the lab and procedures really clearly. If you're half awake when he explains, you'll still understand. Really guides you on what you should study for the midterms and finals. Really approachable and is really more of a friend than a TA. Would definitely try to get him a TA again if I have the chance. Really funny too!", "helpful": "0", "not_helpful": "0", "tags": ["Gives good feedback", "Respected", "Clear grading criteria"]}]}
