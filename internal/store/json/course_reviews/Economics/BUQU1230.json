Honestly, people who complain are the ones that don't try and expect a good grade. You just have to show up, take notes, and review her sample tests for both the midterms and final. She gave 9% for participation, tests worth 15% each, 3 assignments which helped on tests and increase grades !! and a final. Very helpful", "helpful": 5, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Skip class?
