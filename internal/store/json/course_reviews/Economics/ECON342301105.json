Best part is that his exams are never hard. Exam questions are basically the same as what he taught in lectures, unlike other econ profs like PK, Suki, Easton, Friesen, who tries to show off their knowledge by making exams hard. I'm average student and still got A+ in all his classes", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
