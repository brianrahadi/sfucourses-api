Economics can be hard for some people, and then they tend to blame the teacher for that. Iryna explains the content in a clear way, giving tons of examples. If you attend lectures, do the homework, and study a little, you will do fine... her tests and her grading are fair!", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS", "Clear grading criteria", "Would take again"]}]}]}
