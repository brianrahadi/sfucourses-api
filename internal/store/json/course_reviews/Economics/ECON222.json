The course runs biannually and he makes previous exams w/ solutions available. Averages on exams were low (midterm: 30.5%, final: 36.5%), exams were fair. Course was taught like a standard MATH course, comparable to MATH 240/MACM 101.", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Get ready to read", "Participation matters", "Clear grading criteria"]}]}]}
