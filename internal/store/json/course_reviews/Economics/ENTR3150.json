He has no outline or agenda for the class, and lectures without slides or any sort of order or purpose.  He asks students \"yes or no\", and all sorts of other questions, and then rips them apart if their answer isn't 100% correct.  He is unwilling to help when you don't understand something, and often humiliates you.", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 1, "tags": []}]}]}
