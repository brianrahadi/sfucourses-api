The subject is hard, but Iryna is a great instructor, her lectures are great and so easy to study off of. Very fair grader, she'll give you partial marks for trying. Go to every lecture, study the notes and do the assignments - you'll do fine! I'd take her again.", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Skip class?
