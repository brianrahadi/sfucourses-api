I absolutely loved every lecture and spending time with Rudy. He is so inspirational and caring. He gives great feedback and is very lenient and knows us students are stressed and work hard, so he gives us plenty of time to complete assignments. Field trips too. Easily a gem at SFU. Best INDG prof hands down. Rudy is awesome!!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Respected", "Inspirational", "Amazing lectures"]}]}]}
