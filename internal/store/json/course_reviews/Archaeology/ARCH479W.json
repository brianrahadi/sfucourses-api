I love George! I came into theory terrified beyond all reason. Yes it is the most reading you will ever do but he knows how to TEACH! He doesn't simply lecture, he knows how to make topics interesting and clear. He is funny and gives you great class breaks with videos. I can't believe it but...I would love to take the class again!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
