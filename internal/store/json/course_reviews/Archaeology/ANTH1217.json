Super fun class, she makes it so enjoyable, she's super easy going and really nice. Be committed and serious in your study habits, study hard because her tests are all written (no mc) and you'll do fine. She knows a good student when she sees it and she'll do her best to help you!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 1, "tags": []}]}]}
