He is very knowledgable and I feel that I have learned a lot. My only qualm is that the course is weighted heavily on the back-end, meaning we have yet to receive 70% of the course grade, so that's rather stressful. Otherwise, he's a great prof and I recommend taking a class with him.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Respected", "Get ready to read", "Clear grading criteria"]}, {"rating": 4.0, "difficulty": 3.0, "course_code": "REM200", "date": "Apr 28th, 2019", "metadata": {"For Credit": "Yes", "Attendance": "Not Mandatory", "Would Take Again": "Yes", "Grade": "B", "Textbook": "Yes"}, "review_msg": "The concept of the class was to know the aspects of environmental management, analyze, and make commentary.
