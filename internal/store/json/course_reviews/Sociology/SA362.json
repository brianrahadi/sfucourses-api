The material is really engaging. She is very softspoken and shy, but polite and caring. She mixes class up with lecture/discussion/film and is very interested in the material as well. She incorporates student questions into next week's lecture--very in tune with our needs. I appreciate Debbie a lot as an instructor.", "helpful": 2, "not_helpful": 1, "tags": []}]}, {"professor_id": "2010086", "professor_name": "Efe Gurcan", "avg_rating": 2.0, "avg_difficulty": 3.0, "review_count": 1, "reviews": [{"rating": 2.0, "difficulty": 3.0, "course_code": "SA362", "date": "Aug 18th, 2016", "metadata": {"For Credit": "", "Attendance": "Mandatory", "Would Take Again": "No", "Grade": "A-", "Textbook": "No"}, "review_msg": "Efe is very passionate about what he teaches however I found him very unclear with vague expectations.
