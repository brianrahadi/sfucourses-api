Made what could have been a very boring class decently interesting with his lectures. Posts lecture slides online, but ties concepts to the reading material way better in person.

He is a researcher, not a teacher. Be prepared to take the reigns. Instructions are vague, lectures unclear and convoluted. BUT he is easy to work with.
