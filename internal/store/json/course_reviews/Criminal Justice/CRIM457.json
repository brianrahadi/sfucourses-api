He does tend to go on long tangents quite often. He is always able to help. Assignments are done mostly in class so there isn't a lot of work required. The only flaw is that there was unclear guidelines about the final paper. Would take a class with Bryan again!", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}, {"rating": 4.0, "difficulty": 3.0, "course_code": "CRIM457", "date": "Jan 15th, 2011", "metadata": {"For Credit": "", "Attendance": "", "Would Take Again": "", "Grade": "", "Textbook": "Yes"}, "review_msg": "I think he's great.  He goes off topic and can be monotone, but he knows this and makes jokes about it.  He's hilarious.  This class was relatively easy. We did the assignments in class, so hardly any homework except for reading the textbook.  He's definitely one of my favorite profs at SFU.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
