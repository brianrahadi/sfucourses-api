Loved Barry in both. He's an amazing teacher and goes into depth with his lectures. When lecturing he'll make jokes (like sending the TA's up to the students that talk during lecture to beat them) and have funny pictures on the slides to keep students engaged. Would definitely take his classes again.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Skip class?
