Very interesting. Great material.   Brockman is great (!!!)but since its distance ed you don't speak with her much.  There is a lot of reading and writing, but its interesting and easy if you stay on top of it. The class would have been more tough if the TA wasn't so good. The TA could make or break this class, and Sarah was great.", "helpful": 3, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
