He is lenient on due dates and his exams are quite easy with open-ended essay questions. If you know the readings you'll do fine. His lectures can be boring and are often unrelated, so you could do without attending. Tutorials are mandatory but help you keep up with the content.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}, {"rating": 2.0, "difficulty": 3.0, "course_code": "CRIM303", "date": "Nov 20th, 2024", "metadata": {"For Credit": "Yes", "Attendance": "Not Mandatory", "Would Take Again": "", "Grade": "Not sure yet", "Textbook": "Yes"}, "review_msg": "His lectures are not very engaging and honestly pointless.
