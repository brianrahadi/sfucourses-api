Sure, she asks students to answer questions to get the class involved, see who's keeping up with readings. Plus, she's a university prof, not an elementary school teacher. She's the best. If you're having problems with the course, see her, she'll explain in detail - the genius she is. Love her!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
