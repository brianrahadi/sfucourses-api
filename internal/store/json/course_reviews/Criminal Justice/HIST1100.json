Can't believe he got bad reviews. Rob's the best! His lectures are really interesting and I actually enjoy the group discussions, whereas usually I'd rather die than discuss in groups. I love his teaching style. Can't wait to take more classes with him!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Participation matters", "Hilarious", "Amazing lectures"]}]}]}
