His tutorials are straightforward and clear. His exams are fair. But best of all, he is quite a character. I'm surpised he didn't audition for some sort of 80's TV programme like Cheers, Taxi, or the Beachcombers. He needs to be on TV! Makes lectures interesting and sums everything up before exam.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
