But, she was unclear about what she expected for the essays ( first one was 10-12 pages, and the second one was 20 pages). Neither her nor the TA's helped towards the essay. Your basically on your own, and if they like what you wrote, you'll receive a fair grade. Aside from that great class, but boring lectures!!!", "helpful": 2, "not_helpful": 1, "tags": []}]}]}
