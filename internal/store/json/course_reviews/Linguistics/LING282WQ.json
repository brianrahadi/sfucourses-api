He might end up being one of my all-time favourites at SFU. His feedback on classwork, homework and term papers have been quite valuable over the semester. He's great at breaking down abstract concepts by providing examples students can relate to. I really hope I have him again as a prof before I graduate.", "helpful": 6, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Gives good feedback", "ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS", "Hilarious"]}]}]}
