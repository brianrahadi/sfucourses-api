Very personable, but irritatingly vague in grading. 1 word in a question would change the entire meaning of the answer, wordings were tricky and sometimes felt deliberately misleading. Weekly attendance for group quizzes got old fast - lectures were only reviewing previously assigned material.

Nice voice too. His lectures are great. I like how his slides have outlines and clear learning objectives. His open-book quizzes can be tricky so take notes.

Lectures are mandatory for you to do well, but you don't need the textbook because all of his exams are based on lectures. Just pay attention in class.
