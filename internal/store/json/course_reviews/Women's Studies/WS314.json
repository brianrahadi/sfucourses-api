The class was boring and she did not have a good handle on the students. Lectures were uninformative and rarely matched up with the readings. The class material was too broad and disconnected and the assignments were not useful. She is unclear about assignments and then marks hard.", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
