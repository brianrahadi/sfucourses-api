The class felt like a book club and Dr. Bullock facilitated the discussion. This was a small class (20 student) and the nature of the material meant a lot of personal sharing and our small group became quite close over the semester. If this course is offered again, I would highly recommend.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Participation matters", "Inspirational", "Caring"]}]}]}
