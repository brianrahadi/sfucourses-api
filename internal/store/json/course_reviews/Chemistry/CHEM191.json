Assignments for this Breadth-Science course were interesting to do(e.g. Paper bags vs. Plastic Bags) with lax marking scheme. Ppt notes seldom available on time. Final exam took ~1/2 hr & came totally from the lectures. Lots of demos in class to keep things interesting. No tutorials, just go ask him Q's if need be.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
