Steven is very caring and understanding, his exams were really long and very conceptual but if you study the notes, you will be fine. He is an amazing professor and explain the concepts extremely well. I feel lucky for having a class with him.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Tough grader", "Amazing lectures ", "Lecture heavy"]}]}]}
