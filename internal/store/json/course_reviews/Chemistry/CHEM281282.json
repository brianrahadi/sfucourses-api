In all fairness, this is at least the second university chemistry lab you take at SFU, and honestly the mistakes that he gets mad/harsh about are mostly silly things that you should know not to do. Good lab technique and precise questions will go a long way in both lab and lecture with Uwe.", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Gives good feedback", "Respected", "Caring"]}]}]}
