She is super unorganized and her outline is unclear. I literally never really knew what she wanted from us at all. Likewise, her marking is super difficult which sucks because we never knew exactly what she wanted from us or would change it. It was nice having guests join us most classes.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Group projects", "Tough grader"]}]}]}
