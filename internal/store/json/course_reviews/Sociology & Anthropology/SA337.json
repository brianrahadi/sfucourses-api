SA 337 is an extremely interesting course and Jillian does an amazing job of opening up students minds to new concepts. I wouldn't take this class for an easy A... you must attend every lecture and really care and understand material in order to do well. Would highly recommend!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Respected", "Amazing lectures", "Caring"]}]}]}
