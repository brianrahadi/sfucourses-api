He's a very average prof, with strong pros and cons. He really promotes in-class debate and tries to stimulate discussion. But he is also very boring and monotone and tends to be rather close-minded. I think he feels he's too good for his job, in some ways.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
