Clear, accessible for help, encourages in-class discussion. Expectations for tests, presentations, and papers are well outlined - no surprise grades! Course material is all critical theory - which is great because most development courses aren't. Showed documentaries every seminar, a great change of pace.", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
