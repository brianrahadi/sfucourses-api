Took 2 courses w/her. It is usually 40% paper, 40% final, 20% part. You make your paper topic, she gives you previous exams to study from for final, plus a presentation. She looks for a lot of analysis & critical thinking. Extremely fair marker. Really kind, funny, interesting woman!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}, {"rating": 5.0, "difficulty": 2.0, "course_code": "POLI446", "date": "Nov 5th, 2007", "metadata": {"For Credit": "", "Attendance": "", "Would Take Again": "", "Grade": "", "Textbook": "Yes"}, "review_msg": "shes traveled everywhere she teaches about!
