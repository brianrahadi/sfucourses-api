He is so funny. I went to class just for the stories. I did not really learn to much, which might make some mad, but i thought it fun nonetheless. His marking is easy. He seems left-wing, but when you talk to him, he really isn't. Readings are pointless, ur not tested on them. Most of his classes have no final.YAY 4 ANDREA!!!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
