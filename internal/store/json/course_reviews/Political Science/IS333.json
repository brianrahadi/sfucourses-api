Lectures weren't actually boring compared to some other profs. Definitely a ton of writing in this course and I'm not a good writer. Marking feedback was concise and didn't mention how to improve. Not the prof for me but take the advice others gave.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["So many papers"]}]}]}
