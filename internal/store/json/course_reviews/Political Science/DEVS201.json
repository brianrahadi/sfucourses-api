He lives much of the year in Ghana so he has a first hand approach to much of the issues discussed in the course. He gives a clear cut definition of many things, and really forces you to think critically in his lectures rather than just write down definition. Highly recommend his classes!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 3, "tags": []}, {"rating": 3.0, "difficulty": 5.0, "course_code": "DEVS201", "date": "Dec 9th, 2012", "metadata": {"For Credit": "", "Attendance": "", "Would Take Again": "", "Grade": "", "Textbook": "No"}, "review_msg": "Incredibly inspiring. His lectures really challenged me to think critically. He does run off topic sometimes though. Exams and papers are hard to write, because you can't regurgitate what he talked about in class. Great course, amazing prof. Made me excited to get to class at 8:30AM, hahaha.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
