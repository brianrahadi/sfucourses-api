I find that as long as you actually do the readings and have a general familiarity with the course content (In a 300 level course... you should know enough yourself...) you do absolutely fine. Lecture is more about discussing content than learning it. Enjoyed his class very much", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Hilarious", "GRADED BY FEW THINGS"]}]}]}
