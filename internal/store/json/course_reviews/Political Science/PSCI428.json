If you have enrolled in a course with her, I would drop out ASAP if that is possible and enrol in a different course. She is very unreasonable and not worth the time and effort her courses take. In all four years of university she is the worst prof I have had yet.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Get ready to read", "Participation matters", "Skip class? You won't pass."]}]}]}
