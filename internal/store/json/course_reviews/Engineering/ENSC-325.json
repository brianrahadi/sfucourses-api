Homework and labs were much longer and more difficult than in 225. Steep learning curve for OrCAD, the replacement of LTSpice for simulation. Concepts get extremely difficult, but Majid explains it clearly that it makes sense in class. Allot lots of time for studying. Exams were fair but unforgiving if you do not study.", "helpful": 14, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Get ready to read", "Lots of homework", "Test heavy"]}]}]}
