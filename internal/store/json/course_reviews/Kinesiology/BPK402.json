Steve is a bit of a boring lecturer, but keeps things simple - watching the lectures at 1.4x speed was necessary. Midterms and problem sets were fine, especially with the provided practice midterms. If you enjoyed BPK 201, you'll probably like this class too.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
