Great guy, I really enjoyed having him. If you want to excel in his course you need to have strong writing skills. He graciously cut me some slack for handing in a late paper, so he's not such a hard-ass like others say he is. You just have to be polite and hand in quality work :).", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
