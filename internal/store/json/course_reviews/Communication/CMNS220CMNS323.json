Lectures can be a bit sidetracked, but I find it better than 3 hours of boring and dense talking. I felt behind in 323 as I didn't take 223 and Jody was amazingly helpful, his door is literally always open and he will go above and beyond to help you with your papers/assignments.", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Gives good feedback", "Respected", "ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS"]}]}]}
