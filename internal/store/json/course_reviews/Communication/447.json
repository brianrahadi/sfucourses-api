The epitome of a professor who teaches you HOW to think, not WHAT to think. He has a wit to him, and is a very articulate speaker who really is interested in what he teaches. I learned a lot. But not in a textbook way. He relates things to real life quite often to make things a lot better too.", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 1, "tags": []}]}]}
