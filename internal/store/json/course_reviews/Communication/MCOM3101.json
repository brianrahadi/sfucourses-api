Assigned so many things that students couldn't possibly keep up. Monotone and packs way too much information into a lecture. Extremely hard marker. Only improvement seems to be that she now posts her slides on WebCT, which is more than what the previous poster wrote.", "helpful": 2, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
