The topics he teaches are interesting and you get to do work in production rather than just writing papers. Taking this course online was a bit difficult since we could not use the lab, but David helped make sure his students had access to the necessary softwares.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Respected", "Accessible outside class", "Caring"]}, {"rating": 1.0, "difficulty": 3.0, "course_code": "CMNS358", "date": "Sep 26th, 2018", "metadata": {"For Credit": "Yes", "Attendance": "Not Mandatory", "Would Take Again": "No", "Grade": "Not sure yet", "Textbook": "No"}, "review_msg": "Honestly a terrible prof. Not only are his assignment guidelines beyond vague but his syllabus has no dates on it and he doesn't bring up a deadline until about 4 days before they're supposed to be done. Very unorganized and lackluster. Also he just expects you to fumble your way through Logic Pro, never actually taught us how to use the software", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
