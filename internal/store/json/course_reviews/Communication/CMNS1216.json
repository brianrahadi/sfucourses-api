Super understanding, accommodating, and well spoken. The class is easy, just reflective journals and one bigger group project that you choose the topic for. The only negative is he doesn't follow structures, so you have a lot of freedom, which leads to confusion sometimes.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Graded by few things", "Group projects", "Caring"]}]}]}
