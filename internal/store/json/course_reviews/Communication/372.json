She is rude and talks down to you which makes it very difficult to approach her for any clarification on an assignment.  By far the worst experience with a TA ever at SFU.  What good can a professor do when the TA marks and is in charge of everything. Avoid her at all costs.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
