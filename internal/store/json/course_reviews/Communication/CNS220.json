He's clearly passionate about what he's teaching, which is fantastic. His assignment guidelines are really clear (sometimes he'll even tell you the exact reading he wants you to refer to). Only negative is that sometimes the class can shift from lecture to comedy routine, so be patient. Bonus: all readings are online.", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
