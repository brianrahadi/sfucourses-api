Her notes never explained anything that well, often it was pages of quotes lifted right out of the Act. She likes underlining her notes in lecture - which also isn't tooo helpful to my understanding. She often doesn't give any real notes to summarize the paragraphs. I found it much more useful to read the textbook.", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 1, "tags": []}]}]}
