Midterm and Final are online and open book/internet use allowed. When students didn't understand he would just repeat the same phrase rather than trying to explain in a different way. Often seemed to forget we don't all have a masters in sound production and are total beginners. Easy credits and a few easy assignments.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
