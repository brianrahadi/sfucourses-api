Very animatedexcited about history which makes his lectures quite interesting. His quizzes are not exactly easy, but if you actually study you will do fine. He can also be very accommodating when it comes to his marking, plus he leaves very good feedback. Personally I liked Clossey more than I liked his class!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 1, "tags": []}]}]}
