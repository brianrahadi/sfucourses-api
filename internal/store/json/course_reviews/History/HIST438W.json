A tad dry, but clearly passionate about the material, knowledgable, very approachable. Doesn't hold your hand, and gives very little in terms of instructions for assignments. But he's reasonable and flexible. Good insights, and picks very interesting material. Wholeheartedly recommend him.", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
