Roxanne is super caring and understands (possible) life struggles of students. The way she structured HIST 417 was a combination of readings, film watching, and podcast listening which was awesome compared to most courses which are just focussed on very dry and heavy reading. 10/10 would take again", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Gives good feedback", "Get ready to read", "Caring"]}]}]}
