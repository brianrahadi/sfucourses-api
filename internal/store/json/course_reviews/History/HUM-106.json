I learned a lot about Italian film & reading them as texts. Prof is passionate, caring & available. Films & discussions are engaging if you talk (a MUST). Short, informal writing tasks (not hard) until the 8 p. final paper.

Biggest mistake EVER. Weekly films took many tries to understand. Final paper ~3000 words sucked, due after final exams which is ridiculous. Lectures sucked, prof doesn't allow electronics during class. Feedback given only on Zoom. Interest in Italian film hit new low.
