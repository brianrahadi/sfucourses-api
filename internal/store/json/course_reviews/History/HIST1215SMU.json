The lectures were a bit boring though. As they were asynchronous, it made it difficult to get immersed in the materials. Unless you thoroughly enjoy reading further into this kind of material I recommend against buying the text, you probably will not use it. I also did not watch even half of the lectures for this.", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Gives good feedback"]}]}]}
