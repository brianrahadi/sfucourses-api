Approaches the teaching of history in a whole new way. Extremely helpful and present. He is dedicated and passionate about his work and teaching. Loads of reading but so worth the discussions with him. One of my most favorite profs yet. He is genuine and empathetic and challenges his class to not make generalizations about anything.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
