The films were an interesting mix. Discussions were engaging. The assignments and expectations were challenging but manageable, but you have to put in the work. He's very approachable and gives GREAT feedback during office hours (Zoom). You'll learn a lot about Italy and film from his courses. Enjoyed going to class.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Gives good feedback", "Inspirational", "Hilarious"]}]}]}
