This was my first Global Asia course and I found it very interesting. This course had two 1000 word essays worth 30% each--- these were the main assignments. We had weekly readings or films to watch, and we would discuss them in class. Overall this course was very fun, a good GPA booster, and quite manageable!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Clear grading criteria", "Gives good feedback", "Caring"]}]}]}
