MBB 420 (Cancer Immunology) was being offered for the first time this semester, so it was a little rocky to begin with but eventually got on track. Dr. J's lectures are engaging and he is well spoken. He answers questions thoroughly and is very accessible.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Group projects", "Lecture heavy", "Accessible outside class"]}]}]}
