I would not recommend her. Her outlook towards White Canadians is extremely bias. Her criteria is not clear and her comments ridicule her students, very passive agressive. Weeks spent on a project that only counted for 10% of her grade. Quizzes are on over 70+ pages or reading and are much too specific. Avoid her at all cost.", "helpful": 2, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Tough grader", "Get ready to read", "Participation matters"]}]}]}
