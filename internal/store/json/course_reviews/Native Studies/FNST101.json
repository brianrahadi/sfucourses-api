She really cares about the topic as well as her students'. This course was taught as Intersession, so there were a lot of readings to go over, but it was manageable. She brought in amazing guest speakers from the Aboriginal community who enhanced the concepts, topics that we read about. Take her class!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
