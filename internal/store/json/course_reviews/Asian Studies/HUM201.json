The lectures are a bit long (mostly reading the text out loud), and his lectures sometimes go off on a tangent. He is knowledgable about what he teaches. Grading overall is fair. There were two papers to write (1 6 pages, the second 10 pages min) and one midterm.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
