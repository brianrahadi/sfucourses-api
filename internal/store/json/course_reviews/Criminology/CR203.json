Didn't think I would. Took it because I needed another 2nd year Crim class even though history of reactions to crime sounded boring. It ended up being a fav class for two reasons; 1) analysis of historical crime cases was fun and 2) Sarah is an extraordinary prof. Exams and paper were tough but didn't make me cry.", "helpful": 6, "not_helpful": 2, "tags": []}]}]}
