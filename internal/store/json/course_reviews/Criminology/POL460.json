She is almost completely unresponsive to criticism or questions during lecture, but is also perfectly willing to give tons of help outside of class hours. At least for this class the instruction itself was fairly useless; she gave only 4 lectures, the rest of the course being one big group assignment.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
