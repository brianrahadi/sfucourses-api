He tells good stories and keeps the lectures engaging and entertaining. His midterms are a big hard. The TA Jessica Field is very very helpful and gives outlines for the exams and sends out a lot of study questions. He is a hard marker but if you study and take thorough notes during lecture you will do well.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
