He truly cares about his students and is passionate about what he does. Unlike a lot of classes, you actually learn a lot in his seminars and makes you think. His marking is extremely fair and he gives you his notes after lecture to study from for the midterm. And did I mention no final? =D", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
