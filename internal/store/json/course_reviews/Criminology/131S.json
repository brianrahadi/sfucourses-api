Very kind and very helpful; she really cares about her students. Phenomenal lecturer; everything was explained really well and she kept a boring topic interesting. The best prof at SFU in my opinion. The class isn't too tough; easy A but you for sure have to show up and do the readings. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.", "helpful": 14, "not_helpful": 1, "tags": []}]}]}
