But her way of teaching is very \"up in the air\". For a 400 level course I would have liked more seminar-style learning - less emphasis on lecture; heavy and critical discussion of the reading and theory. Overall a satisfactory course, but it should have been better structured.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Respected", "Get ready to read", "Caring"]}]}]}
