Had him for calc 2 last sem and have used his calc 3 videos this semester. Lectures can feel a bit disorganized but nonetheless he explains things quite well. Exams in calc II were fair, some very hard questions but that's to be expected in calc 2. Extremely helpful during office hours and a nice guy!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 1, "tags": ["Inspirational", "Clear grading criteria", "Caring"]}]}]}
