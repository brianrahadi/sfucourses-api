MATH 450 (Topology) is not an easy course, in fact it was probably some of the hardest math material I've ever seen at times. Imin does a great job of explaining things though so I am glad I could take the course with him. I can tell he cares and doesn't have that elitist attitude that so many math profs at SFU have.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Inspirational", "Clear grading criteria", "Caring"]}]}]}
