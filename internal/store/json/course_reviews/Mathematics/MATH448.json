He tries to do a good job I think, and tries to help out, but could be confusing sometimes. Doesnt have the best handwriting... But he is a nice guy. Fair exam, talks slow, funny and laid-back.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}, {"rating": 4.5, "difficulty": 2.0, "course_code": "MATH448", "date": "Jun 16th, 2012", "metadata": {"For Credit": "", "Attendance": "", "Would Take Again": "", "Grade": "", "Textbook": "Yes"}, "review_msg": "RECOMMEND! Good prof, lectures run slow but he explains the material clearly. Assignments are a little more difficult than exams but overall he makes the course simple and marking is fair. If you're interested in broad applications of mathematics he's also good for a chat on related topics.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
