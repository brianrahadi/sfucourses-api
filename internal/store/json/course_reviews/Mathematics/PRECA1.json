He tests on his examples given in class, tests are fair. Can be a bit hard to understand at times due to accent, but he explains concepts well. Also answered my emails quickly. Sometimes if you have a question, he jumps through it a bit quick but overall, I wish he could teach the rest of my courses!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
