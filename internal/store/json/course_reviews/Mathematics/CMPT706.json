Bulatov is a good Prof. His lectures are really interesting, he was friendly and funny. Quizzes are really heavy worth 50% and he expects you to finish it in 20 mins. Final was a bit tough. 5 tough Assignments are worth just 15% only! Just memorize his slides you 'll pass.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 1, "tags": ["LOTS OF HOMEWORK", "Hilarious", "TEST HEAVY"]}]}]}
