His lectures were super clear, and he answered my questions very well. Ralf explained difficult theories clearly so that I could understand and didn't use any rote memory. He is disorganized, but I don't mind. If you really hate someone being disorganized, then avoid him.", "helpful": 7, "not_helpful": 2, "tags": ["Respected", "Amazing lectures"]}]}]}
