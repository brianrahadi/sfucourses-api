Strongly favours you understanding the concepts behind the class rather than focusing on computations. In other words, perfect for honours math and physics students. He sends updated lecture notes throughout the year which provide all the info needed to get through assignments and exams. Extremely good at explaining as well.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}, {"rating": 5.0, "difficulty": 1.0, "course_code": "MATH375", "date": "Dec 2nd, 2011", "metadata": {"For Credit": "", "Attendance": "", "Would Take Again": "", "Grade": "", "Textbook": "Yes"}, "review_msg": "He favors a deep conceptual understanding over exam-type calculations.
