Rina is a great person, and she obviously loves what she does.  I found her to be quite helpful as a guest lecturer in Designs Elementary Math, and her greatest contribution was to help us relax and not take ourselves so seriously in that class.  I'd take her for a regular course anytime.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
