It was a good class. I didn't attend many lectures due to them being at 8:30, so my clicker mark suffered but it didn't really affect my grade. The midterms/final were fair, she tells you what to focus on in lectures. The research paper mark is dependent on TA, overall for a 300 level course it was manageable.", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Caring"]}]}]}
