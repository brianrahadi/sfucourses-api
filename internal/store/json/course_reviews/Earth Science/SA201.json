Her assignment instructions are super vague, and those which seem like they should be worth more aren't and vice versa. She puts a 10% emphasis on participation, yet responds rudely (\"oh..\" \"ok\" or just simply \"no that's wrong\") when you participate. Very frustrating professor.", "helpful": 4, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
