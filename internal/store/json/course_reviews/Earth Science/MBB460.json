Her class wasn't easy by any means, but she was super interesting, always available for questions, and she really cared about her students. She brought guest lecturers and we even went on a tour of BCCA! Though the class wasn't best suited for my learning style, I would definitely take a class with her again :)", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Clear grading criteria", "Gives good feedback", "Caring"]}]}]}
