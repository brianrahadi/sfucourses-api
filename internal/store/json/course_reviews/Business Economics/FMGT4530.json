Assignments allowed the material to sink in before the exam. Course was very exam heavy. Lectures did start to get dry after the first hour in a 2 hour lecture. Great instructor, used personal examples during lectures which were entertaining. Would definitely enjoy having Emrul again.", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
