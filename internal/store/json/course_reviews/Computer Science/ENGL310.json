Very laid back and easy to talk to. He seems really interested in what he's teaching.  However, he's very easily distracted and somewhat disorganized during lectures.  He always seems prepared to deliver an amazing lecture, but he gets so distracted by the class that sometimes he doesn't get to the good stuff.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
