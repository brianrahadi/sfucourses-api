He never clarifies anything, and teaches the easist materials to us. His tests are also horrendously difficult\". Although his lectures are clear, the immense mess and unclarity in assignments and tests (worth practically most of the marks) has made him an unfavorable prof. Improvement definitely needed :(", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
