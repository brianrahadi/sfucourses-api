Slides and homework are taken from others. Doesn't prepare for lectures at all. At times he just stares at the slides in silence like he has no idea what is on it. Still, he requires attendance. 1/3 of the term was taught by his grad students. Often late to lectures or end early.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Lots of homework"]}]}]}
