However, his skills as a TA are poor to non existent. Did not give part marks on the midterm, did not show us them in tut when prof said he would, came to lecture late with coffee spilled on them, and provided no clarity within marking. Tutorials consisted of him rambling about his life and experiences.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 1, "tags": ["Tough grader", "Lecture heavy", "Graded by few things"]}]}]}
