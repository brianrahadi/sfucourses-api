Because the math involved in teaching K-8 is so diverse it's hard to touch on everything.  So Sen focused on the idea to convey the interest and excitement of teaching/learning math in order to entice students.  I'm glad this class wasn't just practical things because we already had to cover that in an earlier course", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 1, "tags": []}]}]}
