She practices it with her students as well, and the class is shaped around that. It's a bit heavy reading, tough assignments if you miss a class, but the course project was a great experience and a lot of fun (put readings to  use). Lots of participation, but easy marker in all.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
