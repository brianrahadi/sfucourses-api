She wears her heart on her sleeve, and shows us that professors have emotions too, just like the rest of us. She sometimes loses track of time as she uses opportunities in class for \"teachable moments\", but I believe that's what great instructors do.

One of the worst professors I've had. No respect for opinions/worldviews different from her own.
