The materials she provided on Canvas (readings and lecture videos) were very thorough and engaging. She's a tough marker, but gives students plenty of opportunities to revise their assignments and do additional works for extra credits. I really had to work hard to get an A+ in her class.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Gives good feedback", "EXTRA CREDIT", "Tough grader"]}]}]}
