He doesn't fiddle around with the marks, so everyone gets the same treatment.  He records his lectures and posts the lecture notes, making it very easy to follow along with the material.  I WAS, however, surprised he seems to like multiple-choice questions.  If you're more of an essay type of person, he may not be for you.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
