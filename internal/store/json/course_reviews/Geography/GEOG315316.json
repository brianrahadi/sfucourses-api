Caters the lectures to that specific class's speed/understanding. Fair grader and very interested in the topics he teaches. Great prof all around. But be ready to write a 10-15 page research paper as well as do a presentation on it 2-3 weeks before it's due! Great sample writing material for job apps though.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}, {"rating": 4.5, "difficulty": 2.0, "course_code": "GEOG315316", "date": "Jun 19th, 2014", "metadata": {"For Credit": "", "Attendance": "Mandatory", "Would Take Again": "", "Grade": "A", "Textbook": "No"}, "review_msg": "Very passionate about his subjects and makes a lot of lame jokes. Lectures seem slow sometimes when he asks questions and waits for a response, but this does not take away from the material. Copy slides and take notes from class discussions and you should do well.
