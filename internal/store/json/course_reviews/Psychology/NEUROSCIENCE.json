He speeds through like 50 slides a class and makes the class both boring and confusing.  When asked questions, he doesn't know the answer half the time.  He's also a dick in the fact that your paper is 1 day late if it isnt handed in at very start of class.  Avoid him at all costs!!!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
