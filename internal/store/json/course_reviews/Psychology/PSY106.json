Martin's knowledge and humour keeps me awake at 9:30 on friday mornings. The criticisms he says in class makes a lot of sense when you digest it a little. He wants you to understand the info on a deeper level and requires u to put in your own thoughts! Overall, one of my fav class i took!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
