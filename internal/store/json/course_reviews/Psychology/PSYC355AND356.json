Totally worth waking up for the morning classes. Respects students personal ideas over referencing. If you need some motivation back for school this is a Professor definitely worth taking a class with.  He can sometimes go off on a tangent but its usually interesting stuff. Beware of his TA.

Cannot rate him highly enough! He is not your typical dry prof, is funny, and I learnt a lot. There is a bit of lack of structure to his lectures, which i know others don't necessarily like and he talks super fast. I did well in the exams. My tip is to take very good notes. He gives every opportunity for you to do well!!!", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
