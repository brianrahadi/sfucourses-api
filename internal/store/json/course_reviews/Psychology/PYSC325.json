One of the few that actually really cares about her students and goes out of her way to help you. Her lectures are engaging and her tests are super fair, as long as you go to class and use her notes to study you will do well. I also took PSYC 201 with her, and I would take any course she teaches.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Accessible outside class", "Amazing lectures"]}]}]}
