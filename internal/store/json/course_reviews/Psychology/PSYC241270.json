His experience gives him real knowledge and credibility. He is down to earth considering he knows 1000 times more than the psyc profs who have only learned from books and not from working. His examples are awesome and he is really funny. Focus on key terms for the fill-in-the-blanks. Videos are boring. Highly recommended!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
