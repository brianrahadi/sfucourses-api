Clear, concise, engaging lecturer. The papers were interesting and so was the textbook.  Very well prepared and approachable. Exams were fair and she did not try to trick. Study the lecture slides and the assigned reading's (mostly research articles). Attendance a must for participation mark (easy 10-15%).  Great!", "helpful": 4, "not_helpful": 1, "tags": []}]}]}
