She's fair and I can tell she cares about her students. I didn't have any problem understanding the material/lectures, very straightforward. She discussed a lot about grad school for clinical psyc and tips which is very helpful and not many profs do that.

Lectures are kind of boring but the assignments are super easy! only 3 exams non cumulative and no final! She emphasizes the textbook for the exams, but I didn't read a single page and got above average. dana and raj are both super nice.
