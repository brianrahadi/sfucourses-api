Usually lectures for half the class, shows a film the other half, then discussion. Really good at relating the history to modern psych. Anyways, the class didn't suck even though I HATE history. I did pretty good on the exams, too, with moderate effort. Very fair exams, they don't take long.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
