She also takes an unreasonable amount of time to provide us with feedback and grades. Dr. Jones often came off defensively and was frequently late to lecture. Unlike other profs, she has one office hr per week and will not reschedule if this time does not work for students.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 2, "tags": []}]}]}
