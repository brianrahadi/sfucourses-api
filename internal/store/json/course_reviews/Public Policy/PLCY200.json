Dr. Bhagat took the time to make sure lectures are clear and easily understandable which made learning easy. The one thing I disliked about this course was that we were told discussion posts weren't going to be graded till the end, and then they just ended up not grading them at all. Otherwise, it's a great class!!!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Get ready to read", "Clear grading criteria", "Graded by few things"]}]}]}
