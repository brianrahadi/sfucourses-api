It was the best class I have taken in my whole time at SFU. The classes were long but nicely broken up by group quizzes, activities, lectures, films and breaks. She was passionate about teaching and I actually enjoyed coming to class! 10/10 recommend a class with her!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Participation matters", "Group projects", "Respected"]}]}]}
