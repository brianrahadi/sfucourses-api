She is very passionate about her own research and connects it to the actual course material. She is relatable and encourages her students to grow, and that's important in one's university experience. Participation is not graded harshly at all. Definitely learned a lot from the 2 courses I've taken with her", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Inspirational", "ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS", "Would take again"]}]}]}
