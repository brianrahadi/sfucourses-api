She challenges students as well as the underlying system of academia - so rare and refreshing. She always tends to over assign at the beginning of term but if more than one person (respectfully) expresses concern she WILL listen and adjust. Highly recommend her class for a challenge and fresh perspective.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 7, "tags": []}]}]}
