Professor Yoshizawa gives interesting examples, jokes often, always available outside of the class. Even though the course requires a textbook, professor summarizes and shares information in her lecture slides. However, she does not post the lecture slides so it's better to attend the lectures.", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Skip class?
