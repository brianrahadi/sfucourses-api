The material was interesting although it can be hard to follow at times. He gives very detailed feedback on your papers which is helpful and was approachable whenever I had questions. Would definitely recommend!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Participation matters", "Gives good feedback", "So many papers"]}]}]}
