Her lectures are terribly boring and her slides are not intuitive at all. Her slides looks like she spent 10 minutes making them and she shows little to no effort on delivering the material. She does not promote students to ask questions and shuts down students when they do ask questions. Do not take a course with her.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Get ready to read", "Lecture heavy", "Graded by few things"]}, {"rating": 3.5, "difficulty": 1.0, "course_code": "CRIM356AND452", "date": "Apr 17th, 2014", "metadata": {"For Credit": "", "Attendance": "Mandatory", "Would Take Again": "", "Grade": "", "Textbook": "No"}, "review_msg": "I took 2 classes with her - Crim 356 & Crim 452Awesome prof! Assignments are not overly long and she marks easily however the instructions are not overly detailed which can make it difficult. Super interesting lectures. You don't really need to do the readings. Overall I would definitely recommend   taking classes with Dr Bell", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 1, "tags": []}]}]}
