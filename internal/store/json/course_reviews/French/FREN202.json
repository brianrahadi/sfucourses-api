She's really nice, speaks clearly and is pretty easy to understand (which matters a lot for a French course conducted in French), and also the course is pretty easy. A lot of the marks are just participation, and the rest is mainly tests which are easy if you've done the online homework. Highly recommend her", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Participation matters", "Gives good feedback", "Caring"]}]}]}
