He shortened the exam to 30mins which is insane. His grading is tough but to be fair he adjusts grades after the midterm and final, excluding questions a lot of ppl struggled with. His study guides are okay, overall a decent class I learned a lot but became a little unfair online.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Accessible outside class", "Tough grader"]}]}]}
