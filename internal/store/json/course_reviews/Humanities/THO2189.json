It was WAY to advanced for being an intro course. If we didn't understand a concept, you would use an example of something we also didn't understand. Lots if confusion, and a very hard marker. I would advise taking the class if you are extremely knowledgable in the field of Theology, if not, stay away.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
