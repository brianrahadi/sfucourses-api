His jokes are often not in good fun and he puts down students indirectly; such as by mentioneing that he knows more langauges or something, or how they haven't read Hamlet? Really? etc. Ego and arrogance combine for a nasty effect. But, his course materials can be interesting and he marks fairly overall.", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
