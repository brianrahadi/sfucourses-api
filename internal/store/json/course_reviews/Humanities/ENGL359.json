With that being said, he is a fair marker, and you can do incredibly well by simply reading all the books so you're well-equipped for the papers. He has an offbeat sense of humour that can be strange sometimes but it's more like nerdy dad energy, so you'll get used to it.", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Get ready to read", "EXTRA CREDIT", "So many papers"]}, {"rating": 4.0, "difficulty": 3.0, "course_code": "ENGL359", "date": "Jun 3rd, 2018", "metadata": {"For Credit": "Yes", "Attendance": "Mandatory", "Would Take Again": "Yes", "Grade": "A+", "Textbook": "Yes"}, "review_msg": "An awesome prof who is very supportive (do not fear asking him for help) and nice!
