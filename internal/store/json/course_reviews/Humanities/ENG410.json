Very informative, awesome sense of humor, and the class flies by!  I also think he is a very fair marker, you get what you put in!  He is also very fair when it comes to deadlines, if he feels has not given sufficient time for an assignment, he will give more time.  Would take a class with him again for sure!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
