He took over our class after our original prof was unable to continue teaching the course and although the class changed quite a bit after he took it over, it became so much better! He is so understanding and caring and will repeat anything you ask him too. He is super friendly. 100% Recommend!!!", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Gives good feedback", "Amazing lectures", "Caring"]}]}]}
