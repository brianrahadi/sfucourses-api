The class Contents however were BRUTAL. One of the most boring classes yet, 9 books assigned to read and they are so dry and boring. Lectures were useless he just went over useless stuff from the book. No midterm which is nice but 2 papers that are fairly easy as long as u read 4/9 books.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Get ready to read"]}]}]}
