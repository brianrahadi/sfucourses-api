Easy class, but how he delivers lectures is PAINFULLY FRUSTRATING: slow, meandering, lots of errors, and most of the time I couldn't hear him. Extremely discouraging, especially when the textbook rendered him utterly useless. Class was designated for 30, only 7-8 attend regularly.", "helpful": 7, "not_helpful": 2, "tags": ["Get ready to read", "LOTS OF HOMEWORK"]}]}]}
