Despite the course work being a bit more difficult to make up for the fact it's an upper division course, I cannot say enough great things about Dr. Cooper. Definitely one of the best IS profs and I highly recommend her.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Caring", "Respected", "Inspirational"]}]}]}
