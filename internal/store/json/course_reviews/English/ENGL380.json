He is probably my favorite prof I've had in my four years of university. Class had no exam but was instead based on a series of group and individual projects which were a lot of work but he was very helpful along the way. Quick at replying to emails is always a plus. Also, he does a good mix of seminar and lecture/does both well.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Gives good feedback", "Skip class? You won't pass.", "Hilarious"]}]}]}
