He is willing to put in the work if you are.

His lectures may come off as radical at times but his ideas are very inspirational and thought-provoking.

He's very accommodating and provides in-depth feedback.", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}, {"rating": 2.5, "difficulty": 4.0, "course_code": "104W", "date": "Dec 20th, 2014", "metadata": {"For Credit": "Yes", "Attendance": "Not Mandatory", "Would Take Again": "", "Grade": "B", "Textbook": "Yes"}, "review_msg": "Paul is eclectic.
