He's one of the best profs I have ever had. Everyone says how tough a marker he is, and that's true but he's so willing to help you, and his feedback is always great. Definitely recommend his classes but for students who are passionate enough and willing to put in the work.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}, {"rating": 5.0, "difficulty": 2.0, "course_code": "ENGL400", "date": "Jul 8th, 2011", "metadata": {"For Credit": "", "Attendance": "", "Would Take Again": "", "Grade": "", "Textbook": "Yes"}, "review_msg": "Matt is the best English prof I've had so far.  His classes are interesting, he is a very fair marker, and he is flexible when it comes to assignments.  I had him for both 300 and 400, and I didn't want the semester to end!
