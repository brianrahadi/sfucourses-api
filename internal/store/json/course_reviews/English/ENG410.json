She teaches well, looks over your sources when you had in your paper proposal and tells you if they'll be helpful or not, and relates well to her students. I've had her twice and would definately take her again. She's very educated and extremely nice and approachable.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
