I've taken three courses with her, and she's honestly the most kind, engaging, and understanding professor I've ever had. She tries to make herself as accessible as possible to students, she gives great feedback, and you can tell she does her best to provide a positive experience for her students.

Her lectures were usually pretty engaging and she seems much more relatable than other english professors I've had.

She is usually pretty clear too.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
