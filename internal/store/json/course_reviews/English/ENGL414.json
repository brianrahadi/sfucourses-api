His lectures are super engaging and he held a lot of space for student discussions and following our own interests. He's an older white guy so sometimes says things that are a bit out of touch but is still open to discussion on changing language and progressive topics.

I had him for two classes this semester and his lectures were among my favourite that I have taken in post secondary. Not only is he hilarious, but I really enjoyed the structure of his courses. The readings for both classes were very interesting and engaging and the grading for the papers was fair. Take his class!!!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Respected", "Accessible outside class", "Hilarious"]}]}]}
