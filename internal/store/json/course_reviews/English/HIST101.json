Her assignments were quite short and easy, although numerous in length.  The only downfall with her class is that most of the final grade was based on the last two weeks' assignment and exam.  Other than that, a lot of non-arts students seem to take this class, so content is very introductory.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
