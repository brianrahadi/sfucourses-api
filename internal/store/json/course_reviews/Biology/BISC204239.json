She gets at what ecology/science is about, rather than having you memorize a bunch of definitions.  If you understand the concepts, and want to know how they are applied, you'll love her.  If you're looking to memorize a textbook, or lecture, you'll hate her.  Very approachable in office hours, but opinionated.", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
