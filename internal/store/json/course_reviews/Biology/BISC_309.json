Clear lectures, easy to follow. Concepts always related to real-world phenomena and examples. Very approachable. Obviously cares a lot about his work. Lots of papers to read, but that should be expected for an upper division bio course. Marks spread out over a variety of different kinds of assignments - not just exam, exam, exam.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 3, "tags": []}]}]}
