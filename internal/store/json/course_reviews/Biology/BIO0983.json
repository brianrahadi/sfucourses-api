Not a good teacher. Tests are VERY illegible. I am usually an A+ student, but have a B in this class. She makes me hate biology, and it used to be my passion. Reads right off of overhead, and doesn't really teach. Highly unorganized. If you do not understand what is said in the text, then you may as well drop the course.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
