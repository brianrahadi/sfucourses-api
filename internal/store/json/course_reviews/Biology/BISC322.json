Super interesting course. Final is cumulative,so study everything. Her exams are fair,well balanced,no tricks,everything straight from her notes. No textbook required to get an A. Just understand, memorize the material from notes. Pay attention b.c she gives exam clues. Downside she speaks fast so I just recorded her lectures", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 1, "tags": []}, {"rating": 3.5, "difficulty": 4.0, "course_code": "BISC322", "date": "Apr 26th, 2014", "metadata": {"For Credit": "", "Attendance": "", "Would Take Again": "", "Grade": "", "Textbook": "No"}, "review_msg": "Super helpful but talks very fast so you get lost a lot. Don't bother buying the textbook. One thing I hated about the exams is that she makes big high mark questions out of a SINGLE slide or a single comment within that slide. So you must remember EVERYTHING and every tiny detail or you'll lose a BIG chunk. 3 midterms & 1 final which was harder", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
