She is so passionate. I will be the first to say her lects are a tad scattered but it's easy to condense the information and pick out the important concepts. Exams involve lots of writing, but are pretty general. She cares about her students, if you need anything, she's there to help.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Gives good feedback", "Accessible outside class", "Hilarious"]}]}]}
