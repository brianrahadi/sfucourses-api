I love the fact that she used a tablet to write notes on her slideshow. Lectures were of a slower pace since you had to \"copy\" your notes as they weren't posted but also good since it limits the amount of material covered. Great prof. Lectures were clear and no surprises on any of the exams.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
