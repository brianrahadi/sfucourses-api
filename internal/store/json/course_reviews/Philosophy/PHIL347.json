Her lectures can be tricky to follow but that was the nature of the class, but she was very conscious of backtracking and making sure her point was presented clearly. Would definitely take her class again.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Gives good feedback", "Graded by few things"]}]}]}
