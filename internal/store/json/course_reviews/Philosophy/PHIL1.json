He provides understandable, concise notes that are essential to the success of his course. In terms of his exams, they are intense and very tricky. The time given is short, which is to isolate the students who actually understand the material. Overall, tough course. =(", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
