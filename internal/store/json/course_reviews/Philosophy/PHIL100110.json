Yes, the exams are difficult, but he never tests you on anything that wasn't either assigned as reading, or covered in the lecture notes, and besides, he scales the grades in the end anyway.  Great prof if you're willing to put in the time and effort, and actually learn some philosophy.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
