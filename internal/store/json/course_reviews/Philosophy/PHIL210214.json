Never afraid to speak his mind or admit that there are flaws in the material/discipline. He conveys material well and is incredibly knowledgeable in the subject. Always available for help and/or beer, and cares far more about students learning than performing well. This prof is the man you wish all profs were.", "helpful": 4, "not_helpful": 6, "tags": []}]}]}
