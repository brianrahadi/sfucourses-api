This was supposed to be a writing course and the expectations were very high but indications were almost nonexistent. No book about how to write a philosophy paper, unusual for 100 level writing courses, and tutorials were useless. Overall a mediocre course,in terms of teaching methods and organization.", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
