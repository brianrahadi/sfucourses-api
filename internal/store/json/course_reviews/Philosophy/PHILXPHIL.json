He knows what he is talking about. The lecture note is very helpful for your midterms and finals. If you study enough, the tricky T/F questions are no longer hard. I didn't do well on midterms but it helped me to get better on final though. I strongly recommend this course. Love his sexy voice.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
