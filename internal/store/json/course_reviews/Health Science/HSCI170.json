He gave feedback on ALL assignments (even weekly journals) and offered great advice about school and life in general. The class was very informative and provided lots of guidance, especially for new first-year students. Hope to take another class with him!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Gives good feedback", "Graded by few things", "Caring"]}]}]}
