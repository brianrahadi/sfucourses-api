Don't take this course if you don't like to read or present - all semester was facilitated dialogues and 2 readings per week, lots of writing. He has great discussions but make sure you participate. Really kind and helpful, the course was hard work but worth it and fun in the end :)", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 1, "tags": ["Get ready to read", "Participation matters", "Caring"]}]}]}
