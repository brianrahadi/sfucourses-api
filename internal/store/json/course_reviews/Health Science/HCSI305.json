However she is not a good professor. Her slides have way too much information in the slides and she reads them word for word without explaining anything. I had to teach myself in this course, the only reason I went to class was for iclicker. If you can skip her as a Prof, do so. Not a good experience.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
