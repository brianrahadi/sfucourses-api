I can attend lecture not take any notes but just be entranced in the lecture and learn so much! He truly wants you to learn things and inspires you to do so. Exams are very fair, assignments are very fair! I loved this course, and loved the way Dr. Mooers taught it. I highly recommend to take this class with him!!!!!!!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 2, "tags": []}]}]}
