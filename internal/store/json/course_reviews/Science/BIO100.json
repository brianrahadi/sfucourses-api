His lectures are a bit dry, but he is very informative. I find myself zoning out a few times in class because of his monotonous voice, so I usually take notes through the audio recording of his lectures. He teaches very thoroughly and makes sure you understand the material. I recommend this prof to those who work hard for their grade", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
