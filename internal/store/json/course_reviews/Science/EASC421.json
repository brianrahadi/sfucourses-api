He has a great sense of humour.  EASC 421 has a really cool field trip to Mt. Meager.  Lab assignments are shorter than other EASC classes.  One lab period is an interactive, realistic volcanic disaster-response simulation which was unlike anything I'd done before.  Great class!", "helpful": 1, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
