She is very passionate on her topics (stress on VERY) and her lectures are both informative and altogether interesting. She teaches the labs herself, so you get 1on1 explanations with her. I'm still taking the course as of yet, the midterm was a bit difficult, but very doable.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
