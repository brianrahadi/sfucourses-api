Keeps lectures interesting with his many stories. His tests are fair and more application based rather than memorizing. 304 and 303 are basically the same class... would definitely recommend taking them together or 304 first (it'll help with the stats side of 303). No textbook, his readings are free but not necessary.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Respected", "Hilarious", "Caring"]}]}]}
