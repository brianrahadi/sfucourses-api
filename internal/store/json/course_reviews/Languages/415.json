The students that disagree seem be those who aren't willing to put in the effort to get a decent grade. He wants everyone to do well, is very accessible for extra help and always willing to help students understand material in class. Arrive on time and participate in class! He rewards effort.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 1, "tags": []}]}]}
