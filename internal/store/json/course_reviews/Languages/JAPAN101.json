She takes off marks if handwriting is done not identical to the textbook, but her writing is not identical. I would not recommend taking her class as she does teach anything useful in the scheme of really learning Japanese, and doing the 101 level by distance would probably give be better.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
