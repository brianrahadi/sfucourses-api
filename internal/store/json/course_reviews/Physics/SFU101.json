He's super caring and funny but don't take this as a sign to slack off. His teaching method isn't lecture heavy but depends on you actually doing the work and understanding the material. He does a lot of fun interactive demos. overall a really great prof, one of my fav!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Skip class? You won't pass.", "Hilarious", "Caring"]}]}]}
