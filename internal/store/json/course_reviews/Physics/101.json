He explains concepts really well, makes everything easy to understand, half of the midterm  questions were from assignments and MP, the final was harder than the midterms but still fair. He is very willing to help and meet outside office hours and is super funny. I wish he'd teach all physics courses!", "helpful": 3, "not_helpful": 1, "tags": []}]}]}
