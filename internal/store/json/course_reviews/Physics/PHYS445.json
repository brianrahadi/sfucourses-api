He is very clear, writes good notes, and is very helpful during office hours.  Tests are challenging but very fair, and he's a good softball player to boot. Know your Rb atom. Oh, and lastly, he offers the premium amount of rigor in his physics teachings.  I highly recommend him for upper level courses", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
