Naturally some resist, because this instructor pushes them to speak with clarity about their emotions and thoughts. This is really difficult for a lot of people, but Gervase teaches the skills needed to do it. Really enjoyed this course and recommend his classes to anyone.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 1, "tags": []}]}]}
