Although the content is really dry, he does his best effort to make lectures really fun and engaging. He's a funny guy, makes jokes time to time - you can tell he enjoys his job and wants the best for his students. M/C on exams are difficult but questions should be no surprise. I would take another course with Chris any day.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
