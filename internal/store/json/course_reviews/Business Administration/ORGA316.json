Great lectures. As long as you show up in class, you're guaranteed to pass. Final was open book like you can bring your notes (we didn't have to buy the textbook). Videos are amazing.

Highly recommend taking a class with him!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Respected", "Inspirational", "Amazing lectures"]}]}]}
