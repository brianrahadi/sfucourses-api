The two downsides are he isn't approachable when you don't get something ,which effected my final exam mark and would've gotten it right had he explained it, and his exams are short but he tries to trick you in them.", "helpful": 5, "not_helpful": 3, "tags": ["Hilarious", "TEST HEAVY", "Amazing lectures"]}]}]}
