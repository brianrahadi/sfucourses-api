Overall, I thought he was a great prof. Don't let the hardass routine the first week fool you. He's actually a very reasonable guy. He said he was going to write a cumulative final if anyone's phones went off. Mine went off 1st day but he never did. His notes are also extremely helpful.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": []}]}]}
