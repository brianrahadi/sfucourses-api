Course gave simple overview of each subject of business, great introductory. 3 hour lecture was too long for subject but first hour was dedicated to current business events, attendance isn't mandatory so you don't have to stay. Would take again for sure!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Gives good feedback", "Accessible outside class", "Amazing lectures"]}]}]}
