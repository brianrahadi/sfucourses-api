She does not give away answers for exams like some teachers. You pay to LEARN not to get a passing grade, what would that serve you in the future. She uses good real life examples and tries to relate a lot of things to other classes.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 3, "tags": ["Participation matters", "Clear grading criteria"]}]}]}
