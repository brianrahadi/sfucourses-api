However, he does not let you make your own groups, nor will he do it based on making equal academic groups. My group was full of people who basically didn't care about the course, which resulted in lower grades for me. Unfair, but whatever. Other than that, he was a good prof overall - although I thought he would be better.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 1, "tags": ["Get ready to read", "Participation matters", "Group projects"]}, {"rating": 5.0, "difficulty": 2.0, "course_code": "BUSI2390", "date": "Aug 15th, 2018", "metadata": {"For Credit": "Yes", "Attendance": "Mandatory", "Would Take Again": "Yes", "Grade": "A+", "Textbook": "No"}, "review_msg": "It's very hard to get a professor like him tbh. He is awesome. He is genuine and he will proove like it's not just us doing this course he is equally involved. He made law easy for me atleast. And I easily scored a A in his class.
