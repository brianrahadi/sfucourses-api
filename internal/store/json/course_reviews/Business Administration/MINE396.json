He doesn't treat the class like a lecture and encourages you to participate. He calls you out if you don't know your stuff/do the work so it can be intimidating at times but it helped me really grasp all the concepts. Classes and the worksheets in MINE 396 are important, prepare from them!", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 0, "tags": ["Gives good feedback", "Respected", "Amazing lectures"]}]}]}
