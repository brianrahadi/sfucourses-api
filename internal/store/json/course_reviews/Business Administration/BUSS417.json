He speaks clearly and is very knowledgeable of the material.  His notes are a little too colourful for me though. The final project in this class is very time consuming.  If you think you can finish it in 5 days before its due you will do poorly.  I thought the midterm and final were pretty fair.", "helpful": 0, "not_helpful": 5, "tags": []}]}]}
