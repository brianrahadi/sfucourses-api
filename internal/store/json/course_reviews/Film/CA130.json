Students that dislike him tend to try to figure out professors and cater to them for better grades. Doesn't speak in absolute terms, gives lots of reading AND lots of freedom. Expects you to love film and be an artist. Lack of feedback is frustrating. Avoid if petty.", "helpful": 6, "not_helpful": 8, "tags": ["Skip class?

Sat in class 6hrs a week chatting about things totally unrelated to film and wasted 7 classes on presentations. Had 2 workshops over the semester but he mostly sat in the corner on his phone.
